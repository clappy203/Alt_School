        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m <strong>Cla-Petra Omaku</strong> from Kogi State. I hold a B.Sc. in Quantity
          Surveying from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. I now work as a business analyst
          on a software team — translating stakeholder needs into clear user stories,
          defining acceptance criteria, and coordinating product, design and engineering
          to deliver useful features.

      <p>
        Short- and medium-term goals: deepen cloud engineering skills (distributed systems,
        resilient design, cloud security); strengthen software engineering practices
        (testing, CI/CD, observability); write clearer technical specs and design
        maintainable APIs; grow communication and leadership to mentor teams; and build
        systems that remove tedious work and scale reliably in production.
