        <h3>My Biograhy</h3>
            <p1>My name is <strong>Cla-Petra Omaku</strong> and I am from Kogi State, Nigeria. I earned a B.Sc. in Quantity Surveying from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, where I developed a strong foundation in cost management, risk assessment, and problem solving. 
                Those training elements sharpened my analytical approach and attention to detail, skills I now apply daily in technology work. Today I work as a business analyst on a software team, where I handle the team’s business requirements: translating stakeholder needs into clear user stories, defining acceptance criteria, and ensuring that delivered features meet real user needs.
                Through this role I work at the intersection of product, design, and engineering, coordinating with cross-functional teammates to turn ideas into usable tools.</p1>

        <h3>Why I Joined ALT School Africa</h3>
        <p>I pivoted from construction project management into technology because I wanted to move from managing discrete projects to building enduring processes and systems. 
            My entry point was data analytics: I discovered that framing operational issues as data problems allowed me to measure impact and iterate on solutions. 
            That led naturally to automation work—first with low-code tools and then with deeper process design. I have actively used Microsoft Power Platform tools (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate) to design dashboards, automate repetitive workflows, and build forms and apps that remove manual steps for users. 
            Working within Agile frameworks taught me how frequent feedback, incremental delivery, and close collaboration drastically improve outcomes; adopting those practices made my projects faster, more reliable, and more user-centered.
           More recently, my role expanded to supporting a migration of solutions to AWS. Being involved in that migration exposed me to cloud concepts and practical trade-offs—how to think about scalability, where to place responsibilities between services, and which aspects of security and reliability we must plan for from day one. 
           That exposure made me eager to deepen my cloud knowledge: I want to pair my business and automation skills with stronger technical fluency so I can contribute to both the product and the underlying architecture that supports it. 
           Alt School’s School of Engineering felt like the natural place to accelerate this learning because it focuses on connecting engineering fundamentals to real product work and collaborative problem solving.</p>

        <h3>Goals for the School of Engineering program</h3>
        <p1>Technically, my immediate goal is to broaden and solidify my cloud engineering knowledge so I can participate confidently in system design and deployment. Specifically I want to deepen my understanding of distributed architectures, resilient system design, cloud security principles, and deployment patterns so the automation and analytics solutions I help build will be robust at scale. 
            I also aim to strengthen fundamentals around software engineering practices—testing strategies, CI/CD, observability, and DevOps workflows—so I can help ensure quality and reliability from requirement through to production.
            On the product and process side, I want to improve how I translate business requirements into maintainable implementations. That includes writing clearer technical specifications, designing APIs or integrations that reduce long-term maintenance, and choosing architectures that make it easier for teams to iterate. 
            I also intend to use the program to sharpen my communication and leadership: learning to give precise feedback, mentor teammates, and present technical trade-offs in ways that stakeholders can act on.
            Beyond personal skill growth, I want to contribute to the Alt School community: collaborate on group projects, exchange feedback with peers and mentors, and share my practical experience with low-code automation and business analysis. I believe this exchange will help me become a better bridge between product thinking and engineering execution. 
            Ultimately, my aspiration is to build solutions that free people from tedious, error-prone work and give teams time to focus on higher-value problems—while continuing to grow into a practitioner who can design systems that are secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.</p1>
